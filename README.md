## 🚀 About Me
I'm a comp-sci student, spending my time learning how to build different things. I have spent a lot of time learning programming concepts and now trying to put them to use.


## 🛠 Skills
HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Java, SvelteKit, React, NextJS, TinaCMS

🧠 I'm currently making Projects in React. Sometimes making stuff in Unreal and Godot for fun.
